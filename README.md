# Analysing group trust in an automated/manual vehicle

This project defines a framework for the analysis of the level of trust in a traffic environment involving an automated vehicle. In the description below, it is assumed that the repo is stored in the folder `group-trust`. Terminal commands lower assume macOS.

## Setup
Tested with Python 3.9.12. To setup the environment run these two commands in a parent folder of the downloaded repository (replace `/` with `\` and possibly add `--user` if on Windows):
- `pip install -e group-trust` will setup the project as a package accessible in the environment.
- `pip install -r group-trust/requirements.txt` will install required packages.

### Configuration of project
Configuration of the project needs to be defined in `group-trust/config`. Please use the `default.config` file for the required structure of the file. If no custom config file is provided, `default.config` is used. The config file has the following parameters:
* `appen_job`: ID of the appen job.
* `num_stimuli`: number of stimuli in the study.
* `num_stimuli_participant`: subset of stimuli in the study shown to each participant.
* `allowed_min_time`: the cut-off for minimal time of participation for filtering.
* `num_repeat`: number of times each stimulus is repeated.
* `kp_resolution`: bin size in ms in which data is stored.
* `allowed_stimulus_wrong_duration`: if the percentage of videos with abnormal length is above this value, exclude participant from analysis.
* `allowed_mistakes_signs`: number of allowed mistakes in the questions about traffic signs.
* `sign_answers`: answers to the questions on traffic signs.
* `mask_id`: number for masking worker IDs in appen data.
* `files_heroku`: files with data from heroku.
* `file_appen`: file with data from appen.
* `file_cheaters`: CSV file with cheaters for flagging.
* `path_source`: path with source files for the stimuli from the Unity3D project.
* `path_stimuli`: path consisting of all videos included in the survey.
* `mapping_stimuli`: CSV file that contains all data found in the videos.
* `plotly_template`: template used to make graphs in the analysis.

## Preparation of stimuli
The source files of the video stimuli are outputted from Unity to `config.path_source`. To prepare them for the crowdsourced setup `python group-trust/preparation/process_videos.py`. Videos will be outputted to `config.path_stimuli`.

## Troubleshooting
### Troubleshooting setup
#### ERROR: group-trust is not a valid editable requirement
Check that you are indeed in the parent folder for running command `pip install -e group-trust`. This command will not work from inside of the folder containing the repo.
