Hello and thank you for purchasing! I hope these materials serve you well. Please, don't hesitate to contact me at johnsjunkyardassets@gmail.com with any questions or suggestions.

Note: I'm using the Unity Standard (Specular) Shader in my setup, but you can easily use the Nature/TreeCreatorBark shader instead. Just switch the shader and drag the maps into their slots. The specular map goes into the gloss input of the shader.

You can also play around with different tiling values depending on the height and radius of your tree.
